# Preface
- Don't think on going to a full 100% FP approach. JS is a very flexible language so you have to learn to combine multiple technices from multiple paradigms. This is called: Sorta Functional Programming (SFP).
- Some tools to work with functional programming methods are: Lodash, Underscore, Rambda. Nevertheless we are going to learn to code our own FP solutions using Vanilla JS.
